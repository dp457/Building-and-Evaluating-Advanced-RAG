In the context of AI, newcomers to the field may experience imposter syndrome as they navigate the technically complex nature of artificial intelligence. It is highlighted that imposter syndrome is common even among accomplished individuals in the AI community, and the message is to not let it discourage anyone from pursuing growth in AI.\n",
